# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis combined results from OpenWeatherMap and Google API calls to create several deliverables: 

  - first, to create a .csv file of random cities including information regarding latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed, and a description of the current weather;
  - second, to filter this dataset using user-provided inputs for temperature preferences (filtering on the maximum temperature column), to add information regarding the hotel nearest to the latitude and longitude specified, and to create a marker layer for a Google Map sharing information about each location;
  - third, to select four points on this map near to one another and create a directions layer for driving directions for a route between these points, as well as create a marker layer to show information about these four points
